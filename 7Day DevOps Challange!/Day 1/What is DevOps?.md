## What is DevOps?

DevOps is all about getting teams to build and deploy code faster without sacrificing reliability. Think of it as a blend of automating tasks, making sure apps are running consistently everywhere, and smart monitoring to catch issues early.

Before DevOps, development and operations teams worked separately with minimal communication. Developers would build software in their own environment, then hand it off to operations to deploy it to users.

But operations couldn't immediately deploy the code. They needed to carefully test it first, make sure it wouldn't break existing systems, and prepare the infrastructure - all without knowing how the code was written.

This created delays, misunderstandings, and frustration on both sides: developers wanted to ship features quickly, while operations wanted to make sure the code is stable before it's deployed.

To address this conflict, DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software.

# ðŸ’¡ If DevOps is a set of practices, what is a DevOps engineer?
DevOps engineers implement DevOps practices in their organization. They...

- Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.

- Containerize applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale.

- Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.
